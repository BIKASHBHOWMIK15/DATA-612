## Mathematical Techniques (First Half)

Matrix Factorization &amp; ALS (Alternating Least Squares):

One of the primary techniques Spotify uses is ALS, a matrix factorization method suited for implicit data (e.g., user behavior, not ratings).
Matrix factorization helps reduce the user-item interaction matrix (huge and sparse) into lower-dimensional latent factors.
The implicit feedback model deals with binary-like preferences (did the user listen or not), not explicit ratings.
Scalability- ALS works well with&nbsp;Apache Spark, which can distribute the computation efficiently.
It enables parallel updates of user/item factors, which is crucial for handling Spotify's scale (millions of users and songs).
Regularization is used to avoid overfitting, and confidence scores are based on user actions (more listens = higher confidence).



##  Data Engineering &amp; Challenges (Second Half)

Scale of Data:

Spotify processes billions of events daily, including listens, skips, pauses, etc.
They leverage Apache Spark to manage large-scale data pipelines and to train recommendation models at scale

Implicit Feedback System:

Unlike Netflix or Amazon, Spotify users rarely rate songs.
Instead, they interpret user engagement (play counts, skip behavior) as preference signals.
This makes the modeling problem more nuanced and closer to real user behavior.

Cold Start Problem:

A common issue where new users or songs have little to no data.
Spotify addresses this with hybrid methods â€” blending collaborative filtering with metadata (e.g., genre, artist).

Offline vs Online Models:

Offline models (trained in batches on Spark) are regularly updated.
Online signals (e.g., recent listening) are handled through session-based logic or real-time tweaks.
