This discusses commercial and non-personalized recommender systems, evaluates one real-world case, and explores issues related to attacks on recommender systems.

## Part 1: Commercial Recommender System – Example: Netflix

### How it Works

Netflix primarily uses a **hybrid recommender system**, combining:

- **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**: Based on user behavior—what users with similar preferences watched.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses metadata such as genre, actors, director, etc.

- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks analyze complex patterns in viewing behavior.

### User Experience Evaluation

The technique generally delivers a **very personalized** and engaging experience. However, recommendations may:
- Reinforce a filter bubble (too much similar content)
- Struggle when a user’s viewing habits are eclectic or sparse

**Conclusion**: Hybrid systems provide balance and robustness, but still need improvements in diversity and novelty.


## Part 2: Non-Personalized Recommenders – Example: Rotten Tomatoes

### Technique

Rotten Tomatoes uses **review aggregation**:
- Critics' reviews are classified as "Fresh" or "Rotten"
- The **Tomatometer Score** is the percentage of positive critic reviews
- User ratings are also aggregated but displayed separately

### Evaluation

Rotten Tomatoes doesn't personalize suggestions, but provides a **quick quality signal**.

### Preference

Between the three (Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB), I prefer **Metacritic** because:
- It weights reviews based on critic reputation
- Offers more nuanced scoring (0–100 scale vs binary)

**Non-personalized recommenders** are good for new users or exploring unbiased trends.


## Part 3: Attacks on Recommender Systems

### Case Study: IMDb & Christian Bale's Movie

In 2017, IMDb users coordinated to **rate a film poorly before release**, skewing its rating. This is known as a **"review bomb"** attack.

### Similar Examples

- **Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel** on Rotten Tomatoes
- **Video games** like "The Last of Us Part II" on Metacritic
- Coordinated social media efforts to manipulate visibility

### Designing Against Attacks

To reduce manipulation:

- **Weight ratings by user credibility** (verified purchases, account age)

- **Delay public ratings** until after release

- **Use anomaly detection** to catch sudden spikes in activity

- **Separate critic and user reviews** and make provenance transparent

**Conclusion**: Recommender systems need robust security and fairness mechanisms to prevent collective abuse.


## Conclusion

This notebook explored hybrid commercial recommenders (Netflix), non-personalized methods (Rotten Tomatoes), and the vulnerability of systems to coordinated attacks. Recommenders must balance personalization, diversity, and robustness to manipulation.
